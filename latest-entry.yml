      Hello there, yes I know. It's me again. This time I have some good news. I'm finally developing this site out a bit more with more of a focus on actually getting shit done.
      There is going to be a lot of work, but it's going to be worth it. This blog is going to be the focus of my inner workings. Not so much a projection onto the world and how
      I believe things should work. But instead a focus on my own self and constant improvement of a singular human mind.
      
      There is much to teach and much more to learn. If you feel the need to look something up, check out this site: http://google.com. It's been super helpful to me in the past :P
