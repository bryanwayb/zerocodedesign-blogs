      This is some example page text. No formatting or processing of any kind, just plain text. *markdown* doesn't have an effect here
  - content: javascript
    text: |
      var exampleCode = 'This is some example code';
      // Text in these blocks will be treated as code of whatever the 'content' string is.

      Now *this* is markdown. See here, I can do things like **bold** my the text and whatnot.
